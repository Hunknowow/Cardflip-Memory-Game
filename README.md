# Cardflip-Memory-Game

A fun little project after learning the basics of javascript

Classic game where you have to flip cards and remember where the pairs are in the least moves.

One of the request was to implement a difficulty picker that changes the number of cards asked to win the game.

And here you go.

And all of that within a monster hunter theme just because I like it.
